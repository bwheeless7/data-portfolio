# 📈 Banking Revenue Forecasting & Customer Lifetime Value Optimization

## Executive Summary

This project builds a comprehensive analytics framework for understanding customer behavior, maximizing customer lifetime value (CLV), and forecasting future revenue growth in a retail banking environment.

The system integrates **customer analytics, segmentation, predictive modeling, and business strategy** to answer three core business questions:

1. **Which customers are most valuable?**
2. **How should the bank prioritize growth and retention efforts?**
3. **What does future revenue look like by customer segment?**

The result is an end-to-end, decision-ready analytics pipeline suitable for executive planning and strategic investment.
