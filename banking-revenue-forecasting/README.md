# Banking Revenue Forecasting & Customer Lifetime Value Optimization

## Overview

This project builds a data-driven framework for understanding customer value and designing targeted growth strategies in a financial services environment.

It focuses on estimating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), segmenting customers based on long-term profitability, and translating analytical insights into concrete business actions that maximize revenue and retention.

## Business Problem

Financial institutions need to grow profitably, not just acquire customers.

The challenge is to:
- Identify the most valuable customers  
- Understand what drives long-term profitability  
- Allocate resources toward segments with the highest growth potential  

This project provides a structured approach for making those decisions using data.
